The ancient seed-sowing game. Grab the seeds from a pit on your side
and place one in each following pit, going counterclockwise and
skipping your opponent's store. If your last seed lands in an empty
pit of yours, move the opposite pit's seeds into that pit. The
goal is to get the most seeds in your store on the side of the board.
If the last placed seed is in your store, you get a free turn.

The game ends when all of one player's pits are empty. The other player
claims the remaining seeds for their store, and the winner is the one
with the most seeds.
